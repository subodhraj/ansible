       name: httpd # Package name, or package specifier with version, like C(name-1.0). If a previous version is specified, the task also needs to turn C(allow_downgrade) on. See the C(allow_downgrade) documentation for caveats with downgrading packages. When using state=latest, this can be '*' which means run C(yum -y update).  You can also pass a url or a local path to a rpm file (using state=present). To operate on several packages this can accept a comma separated list of packages or (as of 2.0) a list of packages.
       state: present # Whether to install (C(present) or C(installed), C(latest)), or remove (C(absent) or C(removed)) a package.
